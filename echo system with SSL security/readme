This is a simplified version of chat system but with SSL security.



Use 'make' to compile my program, and 'make clean' to delete all the executable files. Using 'make' will create 2 executable file: echoServer and echoClient.
run ./echoServer to start the server, run ./echoClient to start the client.

echoClient and echoServer will print ssl and socket information in each terminal.

Type something in echoClient and press "ENTER", we could see that the echoServer echoes the information back.
